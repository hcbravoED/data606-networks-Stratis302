## Implements the breadth-first algorithm of Girvan-Newman to compute
##   number (fractional) of shortest paths starting from a given vertex
##   that go through each edge of the graph
##
## Input:
##   - vertex (int): index of vertex paths start from
##   - mat (np.array): n-by-n adjacency matrix
##
## Output:
##   (np.array): n-by-n edge count matrix
##
## Note: assume input adjacency matrix is binary and symmetric
